    <p class="cooltext">
      As snowflakes dance and twirl Upon the ground and in the swirl Of
      winter's icy, frosty breath, A joyful peace pervades until death. The
      world is hushed, a tranquil scene Of white-capped mountains, evergreen
      Beneath a sky of frosty blue That stretches endlessly in view. The
      crisp, fresh air invigorates And fills our hearts with warm debates Of
      all the fun that yet awaits In this, the season of snowflakes. The
      crunch of boots upon the ground And laughter as we frolic around In
      fields of white, so soft and still A winter wonderland to thrill. So let
      us raise a glass, my friend To winter's joy that never ends For in this
      season, cold and bright We find the warmth of love and light.

        Some of the best places to travel and activites to do in the winter
      </h1>
      <p class="sectiontwotext">
        Winter brings a host of activities to enjoy. Sledding and skiing down
        powdery slopes, building snowmen and having snowball fights, ice
        skating on frozen ponds, and taking winter hikes through picturesque
        landscapes are just a few examples. Cozying up by the fire with a warm
        drink and a good book, or making homemade hot chocolate and cookies
        are great indoor options. Winter is also a great time for stargazing,
        as the clear, crisp air provides ideal viewing conditions. And for the
        adventurous types, there are winter camping, ice fishing and even
        dogsledding and snowmobiling. Whatever you choose, there is no
        shortage of ways to have fun and make memories in the wintertime.
